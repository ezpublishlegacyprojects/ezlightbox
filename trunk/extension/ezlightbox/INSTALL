eZ Lightbox extension INSTALL

Introduction
============

1. What is the eZ Lightbox extension?
   --------------------------------

   This extension adds support for lightboxes to eZ Publish by adding a
   new eZ Publish module named "lightbox" (including operations, triggers,
   fetch functions). Besides the new modules the extension adds a custom
   content action handler, a new datatype for the eZ Teamroom extension
   and a standard design for the provided items.

Getting eZ Publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ Publish from ez.no, you will find the
various versions at:
http://ez.no/download/ez_publish/ez_publish_4_stable_releases

NOTE: You will require eZ Publish 4.0.4 or higher

Information on the installation of eZ Publish can be found at:
http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual


Installing eZ Lightbox extension
================================

1. Copy or untar the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your
   eZ Publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution.

   $ unzip ezlightbox-extension-0.7.4.zip

3. Enable the extension in eZ Publish. To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the
   folder root_of_ezpublish/settings/override. If this file does not exist, create it.
   Locate (or add) the block [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezlightbox

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the sites should use
   the extension, make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezlightbox

   Regenerate the extension autoload file, either via GUI (in case the  eZ Publish
   site is already installed ) in the Admin interface, "Setup" tab, "Extensions" page,
   or by executing the ezpgenerateautoloads.php file.


Initializing Lightbox databases
===============================

1. MySQL
   -----

   Go to the eZ Publish installation directory and run the mysql client:

   $ mysql -u <USERNAME> -h <HOSTNAME> -p <DATABASENAME> < extension/ezlightbox/sql/mysql/ezlightbox.sql

   Replace the placeholders <USERNAME>, <HOSTNAME> and <DATABASENAME> with
   the username of your database, the hostname the MySQL database is running on
   and the name of the database used by eZ Publish. After executing this command
   you will be requested to enter the password of the user. Refer to your site.ini
   file to get the required values.

2. Oracle
   ------

   Go to the eZ Publish installation directory and run the mysql client:

   $ sqlplus <USERNAME>/<PASSWORD>@<DATABASENAME> < extension/ezlightbox/sql/oracle/ezlightbox.sql

   Replace the placeholders <USERNAME>, <PASSWORD> and <DATABASENAME> with
   the username of your database, the password of the user and the name of
   the database used by eZ Publish. Refer to your site.ini file to get the
   required values.


Enabling user to make use of lightboxes
=======================================

Login to the administration interface as an administrator user. Navigate to the "User accounts"
menu and click on "Roles and policies" on the left handside of the screen. Either edit an existing
role or create a new one. Add a new policy and in the upcoming dialog select "lightbox" as a module
name. Depending on your intension you can grant full or limited access to several functions that
are available in the lightbox module.

Integrate lightbox funtionality into your site
==============================================

The easiest way is to just include the lightbox toolbar somewhere into your pagelayout. If you
wish to include the toolbar within a cache-block you should think about modifying it
accordingly, because the toolbar already demonstrates how the lightbox functionality could
be used with cache-blocks.

{include uri="design:lightbox/toolbar.tpl"}

When viewing the content of a lightbox it could be useful to have an additional menu. This
menu is typically also included within the pagelayout.tpl. If you wish a dependant inclusion
of the menu, this can be done as follows.

{def $shown_lightbox_id = first_set( $module_result.shown_lightbox_id, false() )}

{if and( $module_result.ui_component|eq( 'lightbox' ), $module_result.navigation_part|eq( 'ezlightboxnavigationpart' ) )}

    {if $shown_lightbox_id}

        {include             uri = "design:lightbox/left_menu.tpl"
                 shownLightboxID = $shown_lightbox_id}

    {else}

        {include uri = "design:lightbox/left_menu.tpl"}

    {/if}

{/if}

This template does not make use of cache-blocks so far, so it should be safe to use it
anywhere.
